                    <p>Higher Achiever's Group is a great school to learn and to become a better student and person. The curriculum here is very precise and challenging. We have science fairs year round and go on numerous educational and fun field trips. If you listen and follow directions there is no reason why you should not pass with flying colors. I attended the same public school up until the sixth grade. </p>

                            <p>I really value my education at Higher Achiever's Group for many reasons. First, I get to learn about many things I never knew about. Another reason is that the teachers here really care about you and your education.</p>

                    <p>When I came to Higher Achiever's Group I was able to expand my knowledge and improve in what had been troubling me for years at my other school. Higher Achiever's Group isn’t your average school. We are a charter school. Although we do extremely well in academics, that’s not what we’re all about!. Our Teacher Mrs. Karima Organized various clubs i.e Art Club, Go Green Club, Spelling Bee Club and so much more to look forward to. We also participate in many in-school and out-of-school activities. </p>

                    <p>In Miss. Onyinyechi class (our head of the English and Social Studies department) we’ve gone on several field trips, i.e. Pro Football Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, A Christmas Story House, Motown Historical Museum, bowling, movies, Coventry Village, etc. We have also held numerous bake sales, which profits have all gone to charity, i.e. Animal Protective League, The City Mission, West Side Catholic Center, St. Augustine Hunger Center, etc. In Ms. Kratz’s class we are currently doing fantasy football, which is a learning experience for me.  Personally, I think if you are lucky enough to attend Achiever's then you will be able absorb all the fun, factual days here at Achiever's.</p>
